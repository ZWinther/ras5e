# Rune & Steel 5E
Rune & Steel 5E is a module for Foundry VTT's DND5E system. It allows players to play DND5E using the official Rune & Steel 5e rules.



## Features



## Installation
Make sure you have the dnd5e system installed, then copy `````` and paste it in the manifest url field in Foundry:



### **Warning**: Actors/worlds made with this module enabled, will most likely break if it's disabled.

Treat it as an "expansion pack" to the DnD5e system. "Save games" made with the expansion enabled won't run without it.

Always backup your world data before enabling!

## Compatibility

I do my best to keep the module up-to-date with both the latest Foundry version and the latest updates to the 5e system. Sometimes the updates will break something and depending on my work and daily life, it might take a little while to make a fix. Creating an issue will keep me informed about what I need to fix.

## Acknowledgements

I also would not have been able to make this work without the help from the lovely folks in the League of Extraordinary FoundryVTT Developers Discord.
